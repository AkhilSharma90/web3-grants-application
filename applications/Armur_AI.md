## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

About Us - Armur A.I is a Techstars and Outlier Ventures backed startup focused on building A.I powered security tools to help secure blockchains.
Armur A.I is supported by Algorand and Aptos. 

Problem - Many static/ hard-coded tools exist to audit smart contracts but they're definitely not sufficient in being able to detect vulnerabilities or security issues and the issue with hard-coded tools is that everytime there's a new vulnerability, you have to extend the functionality of the tool by writing more code and this might sometimes conflict with the old functionality of the tool. The other option for web3 companies is to go for manual auditing, but this takes too long and is an extremely expensive approach (starting at $40K for a basic audit).

Our unique solution - Using A.I models is a great approach because it's way more effective than static auditing tools because now you can simply train A.I models to be able to catch new reproted vulnerabilities rather than change the code or extend the code, this is an all new approach. A.I powered audit also provides "contextual" and descriptive information about the vulnerabilities and security issues in the code and this can really make it easy for tdevelopers to fix those issues.

Why Polkadot ecosystem - At Armur A.I, we wnat to build for the Polkadot ecosystem by building a tool that enables A.I powered auditing of ink! smart contracts.

Our Approach - We're using Open-Source A.I models and training them. Instead of using closed-source technologies like Open A.I, we're using A.I models that everyone has equal access to, such as - Falcon 40b, LLaMa2, GPT-NEO-X etc.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Armur A.I will enable A.I powered auditing of ink! smart contracts
- We've built a successful A.I powered auditing tool for solidity files (ethereum), we have a grant from Aptos to do this for Move smart contracts and are currently working on this. We now wanted to expand to Polkadot by building the capability to audit Ink! smart contracts.
- Our A.I models will be trained on Ink! smart contracts, common vulnerabilities and audit reports commonly found in the Polkadot eco-system. Since our A.I models are already trained on Solidity smart contracts, this means we would need less data from the ink! community to train our A.I models due to the "few shot learning" advantage.
- Our team has a deep expertise in Rust and everything from the Polkadot eco-system. The Founder (Akhil) has a 14-chapter course on Substrate on his **[Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5dTjWUk_cPYdb4j2RH8BHEAK3z_ZME1j)** and is also writing a book called "Rust for Blockchain Development" with **[Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/)** which has 2 entire chapters on Polkadot and Substrate. Our team believes that app-specific blockchains are the future and sooner or later, Polkadot will win and we want to be a strong part of the Polkadot eco-system.
Akhil also actively advises companies that are fast-tracked in the Substrate Builders' Program.

### Project Details

- The product itself is really straightforward. Our alpha product demo is ready. We have trained open source A.I models on datasets that consist smart contracts and their vulnerabilities, smart contract audit reports etc. while a lot of data was available for solidity and so we were easily able to train A.I models for the same. We need help of the Polkadot community to create datasets for ink! smart contracts and audit reports so that we are able to classify common recurring vulnerabilities and also detect them in new contracts.

### Ecosystem Fit

This will really be a much needed addition in the Polkadot ecosystem. Imagine if all the smart contracts flowing through all the parachains could be secured so that the entire ecosystem becomes way more secure, this will grow the ecosystem, generate trust and also increase the investors into the Polkadot ecosystem.

- Auditors, smart contract developers, start ups will benefit a lot from our product. Both new entrants to the Polkadot ecosystem and the old players will benefit tremendously because now they will have a tool that can do atleast basic audits with the help of A.I models, this means developers don't have to wait weeks and spend a lot of money everytime they have a new smart contract or want to make any changes to their projects. This significantly increases the speed of development and leads to the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem.
- In the beginning, our target audience are the developers, in the sense the ink! smart contract developers that are building applications to launch on the polkadot ecosystem, but the parachains themselves can be the target audience if they'd like to integrate with us and make all smart contracts flowing through their chain secure by default or before they're uploaded.
- Our team has the necessary expertise in terms of A.I and also blockchain to be able to build this.
- Currently there are not products similar to ours in the Polkadot system
  - In the other eco-systems such as Ethereum related chains and Aptos, we're the main company trying to implement this.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  4
- **Total Costs:** USD 60,000

### Milestone 1 - Creating Datasets

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  3
- **Costs:** 15,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 |
| **0b.** | Creating Dataset | We will focus on creating a dataset to train / fine-tune A.I models with, the steps for which are listed in detail in the next steps here |
| **0c.** | Finding Vulnerabilities Lists | We have a 4 stage process and the first stage is finding lists of "categorized" vulnerabilities that other developers or the community may have created, what we then do is find code samples that these vulnerabilities, this means, for each vulnerability we find, we will also find multiple code samples that contain the vulnerability. This will help us prepare a dataset with an input (smart contract) and output (vulnerabilities). Our aim is that the system should be able to catch atleast 10 common vulnerabilities initially and we will be creating datasets accordingly.|
| **0d.** | Using existing security tools | This is our second stage of preparing the dataset, what we do here is use existing tools (like slither and manticore exist for solidity) and we input various smart contracts into them, this gives us vulnerabilites that the tools are able to detect, this helps us to add to our dataset with input (smart contract) and output (list of vulnerabilities) |
| **0e.** | Finding Audit reports | This is the 4th stage of dataset creation, here we will look for audit reprots that exist in the ink! eco-system, we convert PDF data into JSON for some of the sections in the reports, this helps us add to our dataset with input (smart contract) and output (list of vulnerabilities)|
| **0f.** | Dataset Refinement | By now, we have a solid dataset, comprising of categorized vulnerabilities, output from tools, audit reports so we have a good amout of data for the A.I model, data that will ensure that our A.I tool will go wayyyy beyond a standard tool, because with standard tools, you have to extend the code base, but with an A.I tool, you just need to train it with new data. Now, at this final stage, we clean up the data, ensure it's in the right format based on the category of A.I model, for example, for Alpaca models, you need three fields - input (smart contract with issues), output (list of vulnerabilities) and prompt ("audit this smart contract for me") |


### Milestone 2 Deploying A.I models

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 5,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0  |
| **0b.** | Testing various models | Since we have the dataset ready, our job is now to find the best possible A.I models from the existing open source LLMs out there for our specific use case. When we performed this exercise with solidity, we started with GPT-J, then switched to NEO-X and then Falcon-7B and then finally to Falcon-40B, we're actively trying to find the model that already understands programming really well and needs the least amount of training for best results for the specific use case. But since the A.I world changes really fast and there is LlaMa2 now which has been trained on even more parameters, and we're sure there will be many more till the grant gets approved, we will experiment with the latest ones on the market and find the best for our use case - ink! smart contracts |
| **0c.** | Sharing learning data | The way to test the models is that we use small samples, not the entire training set and we benchmark accuracy with other models. We will share these learnings as part of this deliverable |
| **0d.** | Deploying to the Cloud | After trying out various models on our personal cloud machines, we will find the right a.i model and then it's all about deploying it to the cloud and prepare it for training. To be able to finetune/train it, you need optimimum amount of machines so that you can also perform a little bit of parallal training. |



### Milestone 3 Training the A.I Models

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  4
- **Costs:** 20,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 |
| **0b.** | Training with created datasets | By now we have a structured dataset and also the deployed model which was selected after testing, now it's time to start training / fine-tuning with the datasets we have created. Now that these datasets have "carefully" "labelled" data, it's not un-supervised learning |
| **0c.** | Human Feedback from auditors | Keeping up with our methodology of supervised learning, we will train the models but also refine the training based on the output from the models, there will be trained auditors to check the output and if there's inaccuracy for a particular vulnerability, this means finding more code examples for this particular vulnerability or this might even mean that the security auditors might need to create some code samples with these vulnerabilities |

### Milestone 4 Testing the Models and refining output

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  4
- **Costs:** 20,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 |
| **0b.** | Benchmarking | The way we test for improvement is benchmarking the models with an untrained model of the same category, for example - if we had selected Falcon40B we will keep 2 versions - an untrained version and our new trained version and we will compare the results from both to check the ability to detect issues in the smart contract code. |
| **0c.** | Refinement | Now we check for accuracy, this is done by comparison, for example - let's say we have trained our A.I model to detect 5 vulnerabilities and there's a smart contract that has 5 tagged vulnerabilities by a security expert, then when we run this smart contract through our A.I model, if it's able to detect 5/5, we know accuracy is high. |
| **0d.** | Check for hallucinations | In newly trained models, the output usually contains issues or text that is not relevant for smart contracts and this affects the accuracy signifcantly, in this stage our aims to check fo hallucinations and fine tune the model further for this. |
| **0e.** | False Positive refinement | In many cases, there will be issues that don't exist in that particular smart contract, our aim will be here to check for the same, finetune for this or even create "confidence meters" where the model detects issues but with a confidence score.|

## Future Plans

- In the short term- we plan to enable auditors and developers to be able to audit their smart contracts automatically so they can focus more on writing the business logic.
- In the long term, we intend to make our tool way more advanced so that developers would need manual auditors for very few advanced use cases only and most of the checks can be done by the A.I tool.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Our Founder, Akhil has been active in the Polkadot ecosystem and also has a 14-chapter course on Substrate on his youtube. Akhil discussed this project with Dr. Gavin Wood, who referred him to Square One and after that Nico suggested that grant is the best route. We all think Polkadot is the future. A grant seems like the best way forward for us to be involved with the Polkadot community more deeply.
